steps
1. rotate operators to dirac basis using gamma matrix technology
objects: lattice propagator, quark undergoing rotation, spin matrix U, adjoint U*
morphisms: rotation via matrices 
2. obtain the spin wavefunctions for baryon or meson of interest
objects: spins of src/snk, weights of src/sink, spin, parity, species of baryon
why is convention 0 positive parity, 1 negative? 
* i stil dont understand construction of spin up, spin up matrix formulation in code vs notes , entries dont match
3. perform color contractions, color indices are nested within spin indices 
objects:
morphisms: double epsilon color contractions
4. perform spin contractions 
5. write out the correlator

why does hu\ypercubic lattice not respect lorentz covariance? 

operators should be classi-
fied according to the symmetries of the lattice, rather
than the full rotational symmetries of continuous space-
time.
